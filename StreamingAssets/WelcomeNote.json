[{"Gallery_ID":1,"Heading":"Mr Tibbits-Williams","Content":"Such a thought provoking exhibition, thank you so much for sharing. It provided some much needed escapism in these challenging times. I look forward to seeing some of your work in the Tate!
An absolutely beautiful collection of work. As a previous Virtual Gallery, I can fully understand the hard work and dedication behind these pieces. There is so much talent here, and I applaud each and every artist! You should all be so proud of your achievements."},{"Gallery_ID":0,"Heading":"Mr Abby Frances","Content":"Young artists and curators between the age of 16-25 created and curated the artworks in the exhibition with support from the 20-21 Visual Arts Centre, Sam Metz and Barbara Grabher. The works explore their sense of place, and in particular what the word ‘home’ means to them. A home can be a domestic dwelling, an individual place of comfort, surrounded by family but also a bigger physical entity – a town, a country across borders and seas or our collective home: planet Earth. Home can also be an abstract space, a location in our mind."}]
